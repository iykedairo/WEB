Reading from a File
Right now, Bob’s customers can leave their orders via the Web, but if Bob’s staff mem￾bers want to look at the orders, they have to open the files themselves.
Let’s create a web interface to let Bob’s staff read the files easily.The code for this
interface is shown in Listing 2.3.
