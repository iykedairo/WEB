Copies files and directory trees.

XCOPY source [destination] [/A | /M] [/D[:date]] [/P] [/S [/E]] [/V] [/W
                           [/C] [/I] [/Q] [/F] [/L] [/G] [/H] [/R] [/T]
                           [/K] [/N] [/O] [/X] [/Y] [/-Y] [/Z] [/B] [/J]
                           [/EXCLUDE:file1[+file2][+file3]...]

  source       Specifies the file(s) to copy.
  destination  Specifies the location and/or name of new files.
  /A           Copies only files with the archive attribute set,
               doesn't change the attribute.
  /M           Copies only files with the archive attribute set,
               turns off the archive attribute.
  /D:m-d-y     Copies files changed on or after the specified date.
               If no date is given, copies only those files whose
               source time is newer than the destination time.
  /EXCLUDE:file1[+file2][+file3]...
               Specifies a list of files containing strings.  Each strin
               should be in a separate line in the files.  When any of t
               strings match any part of the absolute path of the file t
               copied, that file will be excluded from being copied.  Fo
               example, specifying a string like \obj\ or .obj will excl
               all files underneath the directory obj or all files with
               .obj extension respectively.
  /P           Prompts you before creating each destination file.

  /E           Copies directories and subdirectories, including empty on
               Same as /S /E. May be used to modify /T.
  /V           Verifies the size of each new file.
  /W           Prompts you to press a key before copying.
  /C           Continues copying even if errors occur.
  /I           If destination does not exist and copying more than one f
               assumes that destination must be a directory.
  /Q           Does not display file names while copying.
  /F           Displays full source and destination file names while cop
  /L           Displays files that would be copied.
  /G           Allows the copying of encrypted files to destination that
               not support encryption.
  /H           Copies hidden and system files also.
  /R           Overwrites read-only files.
  /T           Creates directory structure, but does not copy files. Doe
               include empty directories or subdirectories. /T /E includ
               empty directories and subdirectories.
  /U           Copies only files that already exist in destination.
