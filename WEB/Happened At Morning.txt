Job 38 : 4 -7; 
“Where were you when I laid the foundation of the earth?
Tell me, if you have understanding.

  On what were its bases sunk,
or who laid its cornerstone,
  when the morning stars sang together
and all the sons of God shouted for joy?

proverbs 8 22 - 29;
The Lord possessed me in the beginning of his way,
before his works of old. 
  I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning,
or ever the earth was. 
  When there were no depths, I was brought forth;
when there were no fountains abounding with water. 
  Before the mountains were settled,
before the hills was I brought forth: 
  While as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields,
nor the highest part of the dust of the world. 
  When he prepared the heavens, I was there:
when he set a compass upon the face of the depth: 
  When he established the clouds above:
when he strengthened the fountains of the deep: 
  When he gave to the sea his decree,
that the waters should not pass his commandment:
when he appointed the foundations of the earth:
