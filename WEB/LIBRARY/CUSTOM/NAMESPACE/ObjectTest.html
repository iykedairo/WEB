 	Bro, how are you today? I have been worried about you. Our last conversation did not end well; it was aweful. I`m not only to blame for it, I'm solely responsible for the poor conclusion we ended with. Now that self-recrimination will not do us a favor, I'm here for a reason not exactly that.  	 Maybe, this will correct what I didn't do in the first place. 

	<p>
		Only the thought that I'm making up this page solely for it and now I'm going to host it live on my site site privately for reference is enough impression to infer that I have thought about this over and over. 
	</p>
	<p>
		I want to begin by saying that I have acted more quickly and immaturely than I should. Yes, I did. I was taken off guards by sudden and I reacted without any deep thoughts or premeditation. I remember saying, "I dispise you!" . . ., that was funy.
	</p>
	<p>
		However, all these was for a reason. Having very grave people closeby in one's life has a price of disquitening but it has a huge pay-off. I have not remained the same since we talked! I have braced up more, sobered up more and my aggression has greatly increased. I have reacted in all my full capacity to answer the question you asked bewailing why you have me a as brother and God answered me the same day. <b>His covenant with our family is in me</b>. I was glad He did come down to my comfort but my assurance of that comfort was not proven that day; no, not all. I should make sure these things are not a daydream.
	</p>
	<p>
		Since that day, God has answered me in different ways partaining to the same request up until today that I deemed it unkind not to share with you. I want to let you know that we both share the same values, hope and pursuit. We may represent different persons in our places of function but the gaol is the same, it has always been. Bro, you're not alone.

		THE RESPONSE

			Jn 7:1 KJV  After these things Jesus walked in Galilee: for he would not walk in Jewry, because the Jews sought to kill him.   2   Now the Jews' feast of tabernacles was at hand.   3   His brethren therefore said unto him, Depart hence, and go into Judaea, that thy disciples also may see the works that thou doest.   4   For [there is] no man [that] doeth any thing in secret, and he himself seeketh to be known openly. If thou do these things, shew thyself to the world.   5   For neither did his brethren believe in him.   6   Then Jesus said unto them, <style="color:red">My time is not yet come: but your time is alway ready.</style>
